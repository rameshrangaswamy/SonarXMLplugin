<p>Proper indentation is a simple and effective way to improve the code's readability. Consistent indentation among the developers within a team also
reduces the differences that are committed to source control systems, making code reviews easier. </p>
<p>By default this rule checks that each block of code is indented, although it does not check the size of the indent. Parameter "indentSize" allows
the expected indent size to be defined. Only the first line of a badly indented section is reported.</p>
